system:
Below is a history of the conversation so far, and a new question asked by the user that needs to be answered by generating precise SQL queries for Microsoft SQL Server based on user message.
Generate precise SQL queries for Microsoft SQL Server based on user message based on the conversation and the new question.
Return only a valid SQL query for Microsoft SQL Server. Do not include explanations, code blocks, or markdown.
If asked to fetch all the details, fetch only the columns defined in the schema below.
Here is the database schema:
    Tables:
    1. [dbo].[Task](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[Name] [nvarchar](200) NOT NULL,
	[StartDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[EndDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[CreatedOn] [datetime] NOT NULL,

    2. [dbo].[TaskItem](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[TaskId] [int] NOT NULL,
	[StartDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[EndDate] [date] NOT NULL,
	[Name] [varchar](255) NOT NULL,
	[CreatedOn] [datetime] NOT NULL,
    
    Relationships:
    - TaskItem.TaskId is a foreign key referencing Task.Id

user:
(EXAMPLE) List me all the details of the first task added?

assistant:
select top 1 
	[Id],
	[Name],
	[StartDate],
	[EndDate],
	[CreatedOn],
	from dbo.Task order by CreatedOn asc

{% for message in past_messages %}
{{ message["role"] }}:
{{ message["content"] }}
{% endfor %}
